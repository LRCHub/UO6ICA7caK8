I keep going down just a beam of light
With forgotten reasons
Tell me why
Like an arrow, time goes fast
Forgot having answers, maybe
With them, in heart
Looking for something special in my life
With your eyes! Look with your eyes!
Hey, Look! The world will be made by you
With your eyes! Look with your eyes!
And make it big!
That's all? No, no, no
I'm not gonna be nobody. Oh, no
I'm not gonna be a loser all my life
With a will, I'll run
Oh, nothing can go wrong
I'll never get down. Ah, oh
The more time goes, the less I know
Everything I know is not easy
I can't catch it
I'll be burned to ashes, finding out my life
With your eyes! Look with your eyes!
Look, your inside is locked by you!
With your eyes! Look with your eyes!
Be rid of it!
That's all? No, no, no
I'm not gonna be nobody. Oh, no
I'm not gonna be a loser all my life
With a will, I'll run
Oh, nothing can go wrong
I'll never get down. Ah, oh
With your eyes! Look with your eyes!
Hey, Look! The world will be made by you
With your eyes! Look with your eyes!
And make it big!
That's all? No, no, no
I'm not gonna be nobody. Oh, no
I'm not gonna be a loser all my life
With a will, I'll run
Oh, nothing can go wrong
I'll never get down. Ah, oh
